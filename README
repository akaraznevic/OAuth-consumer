This repository offers an abstraction around PECL's OAuth class which makes it even more easy to setup an OAuth Provider.
If you want to start using this immediately, simply follow the minimal setup instructions. If you want to
adapt the code to suit your own datastore or framework check the customizing section.


Notes:

This OAuth provider is setup as an OAuth v1.0a provider. OAuth 2.0 is currently not taken into account.


Minimal setup instructions:

1. Import the table definitions from the file lib/tables.sql in your database.
2. Setup the endpoint scripts in your own application
3. Setup the authorize page (see example's of how to do that in the example folder)


Design defence:

This is a playground project, I might have made design choices you wouldn't have. There is stuff I don't
like as well.

For instance the Configuration::getDataStore() is called way to much. I isolated it to OAuthProviderWrapper
but inside it I simply need it at some places (callback functions) and I think it is prettier to have the whole
class behave in the same manner the have it differ from function to function.

Another thing I currently don't like is the save construction where getId is used forcing the models to
have a getId function.
